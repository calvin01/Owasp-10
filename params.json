The OWASP Top Ten represents a broad consensus about what the most critical web application security flaws are. Project members include a variety of security experts from around the world who have shared their expertise to produce this list. Versions of the 2007 and 2010 Top 10 were translated into English, French, Spanish, Japanese, Korean and Turkish and other languages. Translations for the 2010 version are posted here and translation efforts for the 2013 version are underway and will be posted here as they become available.\r\n\r\nThe final version of the OWASP Top 10 for 2013 is available here: [OWASP Top 10 - 2013](https://github.com/OWASP/Top_Ten/tree/2013/2013/Documents)\r\n\r\nThe OWASP Top 10 - 2013 is as follows:\r\n\r\n* A1 Injection\r\n* A2 Broken Authentication and Session Management\r\n* A3 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\r\n* A4 Insecure Direct Object References\r\n* A5 Security Misconfiguration\r\n* A6 Sensitive Data Exposure\r\n* A7 Missing Function Level Access Control\r\n* A8 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\r\n* A9 Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities\r\n* A10 Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards\r\n\r\nWe urge all companies to adopt this awareness document within their organization and start the process of ensuring that their web applications do not contain these flaws.
